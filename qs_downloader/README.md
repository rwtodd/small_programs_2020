# QS-Downloader Scripts

Just some scripts I made to get QuestStudios' Sierra Game soundtracks
onto my harddrive.  I had gotten them in .ogg format a long time ago, but
where possible I need the MP3s now.

## External Tools needed

 - id3v2 (`apt install id3v2`)
 - imagemagick (`apt install imagemagick`)
 - curl (you probably have it)
