# Archival scripts

As I keep my own backups on external hard drives, I like to also keep a
little redundant data to fight bit rot.  These are scripts to help me do
that.

 - par2pct.sh: awk script to double-check the percentage of space used by
   par2 files in a directory.
 - redo-par-bkup.sh: a script to create the par files
 - space-to-underscore.sh: a script to replace spaces with underscores in
   files under the current directory
