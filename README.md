# 2020 Small Programs

These are just random programs I didn't want to
make whole repositories for.  I make a new repository once a year.

- __archival__ some scripts related to archiving and protecting my files
- __calendar\_ppr__ groff report describing a derivation of a calendar calculation I needed for discordian dates.
- __chaldean\_order__ some elisp code to play with planetary orderings
- __digit\_counts__ small programs (.el, .crystal, .rb, ...) to count
  the occurrences of each digit in large numbers
- __djvu\_metadata__ scripts in golang and scala to facilitate the mass editing of DjVu file metadata.
- __elisp\_fragments__ just what it says on the tin
- __ffmpeg-transcode__ powershell script to facilitate converting some movies I had with ffmpeg.
- __geomancy-totals__ elisp code to tally geomantic figures
- __gradle\_test1__ some basic gradle files, following their tutorials
- __music-scripts__ various batch, powershell, and bash scripts which are variations on how I like to convert FLAC files for portable listening.
- __qs\_downloader__ bash scripts to make it ease to (re)download the various vorbis and MP3 files I like from Quest Studios.  It was an exercise in using base arrays and maps.
- __schillinger__ playing with lua coroutines and schillinger music patterns.
- __xwin1__ a very basic x-windows program in C
